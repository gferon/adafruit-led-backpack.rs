# adafruit-lcd-backpack

Additional features on top of the [`ht16k33` crate](https://crates.io/crates/ht16k33) to drive an Adafruit 8x8 bicolor LED backpack (using traits from `embedded-hal`).

It basically enables to address LED by color with the coordinate where `(0,0)` is at the bottom-left corner.
