Additional features on top of the [`ht16k33` crate](https://crates.io/crates/ht16k33) to drive an [Adafruit 8x8 bicolor LED backpack](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/bi-color-8x8-matrix) using traits from `embedded-hal`.

It basically enables to address LED by color with the coordinate where `(0,0)` is at the bottom-left corner.
